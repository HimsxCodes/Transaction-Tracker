# Transaction Tracker
Simple income & expense tracker built with **only HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. It lets you add transactions (item, amount, income/expense), see totals, delete any transaction, and it **persists data in `localStorage`** so your list and balance remain even after refresh or browser close.
